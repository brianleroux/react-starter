## Node Library

### Usage

## FAQ

### phonegap: command not found

#### Problem

The PhoneGap CLI installs successfully but you do not have a command `phonegap`.

#### Reason

Depending on how `node` and `npm` were installed, your globally installed npm
modules may not be in your `PATH`.

#### Solution

At the bottom of your `npm install -g phonegap` installation log, you will see the following:

    ...
    /usr/local/share/npm/bin/phonegap -> /usr/local/share/npm/lib/node_modules/phonegap/bin/phonegap.js
    ...

_(Your path may be slightly different)_

Open `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc`, depending on what exists on your system, and add following line:

    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/share/npm/bin

Open a new terminal tab or type the following command:

    $ source ~/.profile
    or
    $ source ~/.bashrc

The command `phonegap` should now be available to you.

### The provided path is not an Android project

#### Problem

You receive the following error message when building an Android project:

    throw new Error('The provided path "' + project + '" is not an Android

#### Reason

The first time that you build for a platform, the framework is downloaded from Apache Cordova.

The framework is stored locally in your home directory, such as `~/.cordova/lib`.

Sometimes the framework is corrupted during the download. It can exist for two
know reasons:

1. Your Android SDK environment is not properly configured.
1. Unknown issue related to Apache's servers or the untar operation.

#### Solution

First, you must properly configure your Android environment by following
the [platform setup guide](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.0.0/guide_platforms_android_index.md.html).

Next, you must delete the cached Cordova Android framework (`x.x.x` is your version):

    ~/.cordova/lib/android/cordova/x.x.x

Next, you can try to rebuild the project. Enabling verbose mode is sometimes helpful:

    $ phonegap build android --verbose

## Upgrading Cordova

There are a few steps that should be taken when upgrading to a new version of the
[cordova-cli](http://github.com/apache/cordova-cli).

1. Update the `package.json` dependencies version for `cordova`.

        {
          "dependencies": {
            "cordova": "3.1.0"
          }
        }

1. Update the `package.json` version.

        {
          "version": "3.1.0-0.15.0"
        }

1. Run the tests.

        $ npm test

1. Commit stating the version increment.

        $ git commit -am "Version 3.1.0-0.15.0"

1. Tag the version commit.

        $ git tag 3.1.0-0.15.0

1. Update the [PhoneGap Hello World App](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-hello-world) to match the new version.
  - See [Update instructions](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-hello-world#updating-the-application).
  - In the above example, we would update the app to `3.1.0`.
1. Manually test that the latest Hello World app is lazy-loaded.

        # Link the phonegap-cli for easier development (only need to do once).

        $ cd phonegap-cli/
        $ [sudo] npm link .

        # Manually test and verify hello world app is lazy-loaded.

        $ phonegap create my-app
        [phonegap] missing library phonegap/www/3.1.0
        [phonegap] downloading https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-hello-world/archive/3.1.0.tar.gz...
        [phonegap] created project at /Users/mwbrooks/Development/sandbox/my-app

        $ cd my-app/
        $ phonegap run ios

1. Push the git commit after the Hello World has been updated.

        $ git push phonegap master

1. Publish the npm release.

        $ npm publish
