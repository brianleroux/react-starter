## Commit Message Format

    [#15] The summary should not exceed 50 characters.

    The body is optional and separated by a line break.
    In the body, you can add additional details about
    the commit.

    The summary should always be prefixed with [xxx].

    The value describes the type of commit, such as:
      - [lib]  for the library code.
      - [cli]  for the CLI code.
      - [doc]  for the README or other docs.
      - [spec] for the tests
      - [npm]  for package.json or other NPM bits.
      - [git]  for .gitignore
      - [#13]  for a specific issue.

   The exception to the summary prefix is tagging a
   version release:
     - Version x.x.x
